## Overview  
The **Student Manager** is a C++ program that allows users to manage student records efficiently. It provides functionalities to add, remove, and display student information using a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features  
- **Add a Student**: Insert a student into the system with a unique ID.  
- **Remove a Student**: Delete a student by ID.  
- **Display Students**: View the list of students with their details.  

## File Structure  
```
/StudentManagerProject
│── StudentManager.h      // Header file containing class definition
│── StudentManager.cpp    // Implementation of StudentManager class
│── main.cpp              // Entry point for running the program
│── README.md             // Project documentation
│── Makefile              // Compilation instructions (optional)
```

## Compilation and Execution  
### Using g++ (Linux/Mac/Windows with MinGW)  
```sh
g++ -o student_manager main.cpp StudentManager.cpp
./student_manager
```

### Using Makefile (if available)  
```sh
make
./student_manager
```

## Usage  
1. **Add Student**  
   - Provide student name, ID, and grade.  
   - If the ID already exists, an error message will be displayed.  

2. **Remove Student**  
   - Enter the student ID to remove the corresponding record.  
   - If the ID does not exist, an error message will be displayed.  

3. **Display Students**  
   - Lists all students currently stored in the system.  
   - Shows student ID, name, and grade.  

## Example Output  
```
Student List:
ID: 101, Name: Alice Johnson, Grade: 85.5
ID: 102, Name: Bob Smith, Grade: 92.0
```

## Future Enhancements  
- Add file-based storage to save student records persistently.  
- Implement sorting by name or grade.  
- Introduce a graphical user interface (GUI).
